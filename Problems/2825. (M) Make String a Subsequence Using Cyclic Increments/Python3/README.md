## 2825. (M) Make String a Subsequence Using Cyclic Increments

### `solution.py`
Given the string of lowercase English letters `str1`, we can select a set of characters and cyclicly increment the selected characters. A cyclic increment involves changing a character into the letter that comes after it in the English alphabet. For example, `a` would become `b`, `j` would become `k`, and `z` would become `a`. Our task is to determine whether the string `str2` can be made into a subsequence of `str1` after performing the described operation at most once.  
We can easily solve this problem through a two pointer approach, greedily matching characters of `str2` against that of `str1`. For this specific problem, we simply need to match against the cyclicly incremented character of each character in `str1` in addition to the original character. Whenever we match all characters in `str2`, we know that it can be made into a substring of `str1`, and we immediately return `True`.  

#### Conclusion
This solution has a time complexity of $O(m+n)$, where $m$ and $n$ are the lengths of `str1` and `str2`. The space complexity is $O(1)$.
