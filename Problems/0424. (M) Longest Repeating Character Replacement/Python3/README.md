## 424. (M) Longest Repeating Character Replacement

### `solution.py`
If we fix the target to a single character, the problem becomes a simple sliding window problem that takes $O(n)$ time to run. Since the alphabet of `s` is rather small, we can take a brute-force approach and compute the longest replacement substring for each and every character.  

#### Conclusion
This solution takes $O(mn)$ time to run, where $m$ is the number of characters in the alphabet of `s`, and $n$ is the length of `s`. The space complexity is $O(1)$.
