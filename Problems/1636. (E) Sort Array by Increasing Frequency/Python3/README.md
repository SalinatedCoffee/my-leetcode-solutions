## 1636. (E) Sort Array by Increasing Frequency

### `solution.py`
Given the list of integers `nums` we are asked to sort its elements in ascending order of their frequency, and in descending order of their value for elements with equal frequency. This can be easily achieved by sorting `nums` using tuples as keys, since the Python sorts tuples lexicographically by default(if the first item of both elements are equal, compare the next item, they are also equal, use the next item...). The frequency of each unique value is first generated by instantiating the counter `freq` passing `nums` as an argument. We can now sort `nums` with custom keys generated by a lambda function, which takes a value `i` and returns the tuple `(freq[i], -i)`. The value is negated in the tuple since we are asked to sort by values in descending order.  

#### Conclusion
This solution has a time complexity of $O(n\log n)$ where $n$ is the length of `nums`. Instantiating `freq` takes $O(n)$ time, while sorting `nums` using the custom key takes $O(kn\log n)$ time where $k$ is the number of criteria being used in the comparisons. Since we are using 2 criteria regardless of the size of the input, the time complexity of this step is $O(n\log n)$. The space complexity is $O(n)$, due to `freq` and the sorting step.
