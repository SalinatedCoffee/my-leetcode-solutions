## 2958. (M) Length of Longest Subarray With at Most K Frequency

### `solution.py`
A brute force solution would involve evaluating all subarrays of `nums`. There are $O(n^2)$ subarrays of an array of length $n$, and evaluating each subarray will take $O(n)$ time. This is quite obviously, not optimal at all, and we must look for a different means in which to solve this problem. Thankfully, the problem
