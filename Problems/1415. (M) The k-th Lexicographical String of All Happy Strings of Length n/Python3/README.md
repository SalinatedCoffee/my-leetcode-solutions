## 1415. (M) The k-th Lexicographical String of All Happy Strings of Length n

### `solution.py`
A 'happy' string is a string comprised of only `a`s, `b`s, or `c`s, and `s[i] != s[i+1]` for all possible `i` in the range `0 <= i < len(s)-1`. Given the positive integers `n` and `k`, we are asked to return the `k`th lexicographically small happy string with length `n`.  
Because `n` and `k` are relatively small, we can explicitly generate all `k` happy strings in ascending lexicographical order. To achieve this, we can
